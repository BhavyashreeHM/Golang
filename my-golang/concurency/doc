An unbuffered channel is created without any capacity specification. 
These channels facilitate synchronous communication between goroutines; 
a send operation on an unbuffered channel blocks until another goroutine reads from it, and vice-versa.

Use Unbuffered Channels for strict synchronization scenarios where the timing of senders and receivers must be coordinated.

If you are creating an application where operations must be confirmed before proceeding with others (such as handling financial transactions), unbuffered channels might be desirable for their blocking behavior.




A buffered channel has a capacity that determines how many values it can hold before it starts blocking. 
This allows for asynchronous communications as it doesn't require both sending and receiving operations to wait for each other.

Use Buffered Channels to allow senders to progress without blocking when receivers are potentially not ready.
Conversely, if you are dealing with data streaming from multiple sources where delays are intolerable, buffered channels can help smooth variations in handling time by letting senders keep sending values.
